My leadership tenure is marked by a proven ability to guide teams, manage daily operations, and effectively handle diverse incidents. I possess strong project management skills, honed through initiatives ranging from establishing small reference laboratories to launching hospital laboratories.
Complementing my practical experience, I have earned certifications such as the Microsoft Certified: SC-900: Security, Compliance, and Identity Fundamentals, and completed specialized coursework in cybersecurity and cloud engineering from reputable providers like Coursera, Google, Amazon(AWS), and Microsoft(Microsoft Learn). This blend of experiences positions me uniquely for a successful transition into cloud security and engineering roles.
Driven by a passion for continuous learning and growth, I am excited to embark on this new journey, leveraging my technical acumen and meticulous attention to detail to contribute to the ever-evolving field of cybersecurity.
